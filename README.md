# brownlab-workflow
This is a tutorial for the phylogenomic workflow used by the Brown lab, where we use [UCEs](https://www.ultraconserved.org/) to uncover evolutionary histories, mostly in Neotropical poison frogs (Dendrobatidae). In this tutorial I provide sample data and take you through the steps of read processing, sequence assembly, read-to-locus matching, sequence alignment, and finally provide a few examples of phylogenetic analyses that can be performed on UCE data.
