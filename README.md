# brownlab-workflow
This is a tutorial for the phylogenomic workflow used by the Brown lab, where we use [UCEs](https://www.ultraconserved.org/) to uncover evolutionary histories, mostly in Neotropical poison frogs (Dendrobatidae). In this tutorial I provide sample data and take you through the steps of read processing, sequence assembly, read-to-locus matching, and sequence alignment, and finally provide a few examples of phylogenetic analyses that can be performed on UCE data.
## Directory structure and example files
In this tutorial I will be using a Linux machine (named Bender) for all steps. We need to start by creating a directory to put the example data in. 
## Read trimming
## Sequence assembly
## Locus matching
## Sequence alignment
## Phylogenetic analysis
